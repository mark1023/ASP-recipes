This a web application containing Vegan Recipes, specifically aimed at those looking to get/stay in shape.

The application was created using ASP.NET (C#) web forms with MS SQL Server for the back-end, along with HTML (Bootstrap), CSS, and Javascript (including jQuery with some AJAX).

Users can log in, post a recipe, comment on a recipe, and add tags to a recipe.
